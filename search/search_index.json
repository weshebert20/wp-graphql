This doesn't mean that the plugin isn't ready for use, it just means that there \nmight\n still be \nbugs\n and that there \nmight\n be breaking changes to the shape of the API or internal functions as we work toward a stable release. \n\n\nDon't hesitate to start using the plugin, but just be sure to follow along with \nreleases\n \nand keep up to date with conversations in \nSlack (join here)\n \n\n\nWPGraphQL is already in use in production on several sites, including \nwork.qz.com\n, \nhopelabs.org\n and more.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WPGraphQL?\n\n\nWPGraphQL is A free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides an extendable \nGraphQL\n GraphQL Schema and API for any WordPress site.\n\n\nWPGraphQL provides a GraphQL API and \n/graphql\n endpoint for your WordPress site, allowing for interaction with WordPress data using \nGraphQL Queries and Mutations\n.\n\n\nWhat is GraphQL?\n\n\nGraphQL is an open source technical specification, developed and maintained by Facebook, for an application level query language. \n\n\nWhat does that mean? Basically GraphQL provides a consistent way to make declarative queries, which will enable you to more easily retrieve the data you want, and the shape that you want it in. \n\n\nGraphQL can be implemented in any language and can cover a vast amount of use cases. \n\n\nWPGraphQL exposes a WordPress installation's data through a GraphQL API. You can send a GraphQL request over HTTP to the \n/graphql\n endpoint provided by the plugin and in response you will get the matching JSON representation of your data.\n\n\n\n\nUse WPGraphQL without HTTP requests\n\n\nYou can also use GraphQL Queries and Mutations from within WordPress PHP without the need for HTTP network requests. \nLearn more\n\n\n\n\nWhy use WPGraphQL?\n\n\nWPGraphQL is arguably the easiest \nand\n most efficient way to interact with WordPress data.\n\n\nGraphQL enables small, efficient responses by only retrieving and returning exactly what was asked for, and nothing more.\n\n\nWPGraphQL helps reduce:\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Requests:\n Multiple resources can be fetched in a single request\n\n\nResponse size:\n Only the fields asked for are returned minimizing the payload downloaded by the client\n\n\nEndpoint Bloat:\n GraphQL provides a single endpoint and allows clients to ask for what they want from the single source. No need to memorize and maintain various feature endpoints.\n\n\nExternal Documentation:\n GraphQL is self-documenting, reducing the time and resources needed for maintaining API documentation\n\n\nTotal SQL queries:\n GraphQL queries can ask for multiple resources, or nested resources in a single request allowing GraphQL to determine the most efficient way to get the data from the database with as few SQL queries as possible.\n\n\nCode Duplication:\n Because GraphQL exposes all server capabilities in a single Schema, there's no need to duplicate code for various endpoints. The client can control the shape of their model without specific feature endpoint, which typically requires duplicate server code.\n\n\nOver/Under Fetching:\n With REST, you are constantly over and under-fetching at the same time. Endpoints typically have more data than you need, and not enough requiring round-trips to get other resources. GraphQL returns exactly what was asked for and can handle connections in a single request.\n\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL helps improve:\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\n WPGraphQL utilizies existing WordPress Core APIs, such as WP_Query, so caching and filters are respected, but WPGraphQL also makes use of deferred resolvers and some look-ahead techniques (as all fields are known in the request before execution begins), allowing for data to be fetched and returned with as few SQL queries as possible. \n\n\nDeveloper Happiness:\n The strong-type system and explicit nature of GraphQL requests makes it easy for developers to understand GraphQL query and mutation requests long after code is written. Additionally, code duplication is drastically reduced as the API is defined in one spot, not in feature endpoints.\n\n\nVersioning:\n REST APIs and other APIs can be difficult to version. GraphQL makes \nevolving the API\n much easier than how other APIs are versioned. \n\n\nClient/Server Decoupling:\n Since the GraphQL server describes the capabilities and the client defines the shape of the model, the coupling between client and server is loosened. Clients can iterate their models without custom endpoints needing to be created or updated.\n\n\n\n\nHow does WPGraphQL Work?\n\n\nWPGraphQL adds a \n/graphql\n endpoint to your WordPress install. \n\n\nWhen HTTP requests are made to that endpoint, WPGraphQL executes the GraphQL request. \n\n\n\n\nUse WPGraphQL without HTTP requests\n\n\nYou can also use GraphQL Queries and Mutations from within WordPress PHP without the need for HTTP network requests. \nLearn more\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of the execution process, is validating the Query. Since GraphQL is centered around a strong typed Schema, before any real execution begins GraphQL can compare the request against the Schema to make sure the request is even valid. \n\n\nIf it's invalid, no execution occurs, errors are returned right away. \n\n\nIf the request is valid, GraphQL breaks down the fields and resolves them as a tree, passing the resolved data down to the next fields in the tree. \n\n\nTake this query for example: \n\n\n{\n  post(id:\n...\n) {\n     id\n     title\n     customField\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the Scenes, GraphQL uses native WordPress Core functions to resolve the post by it's ID. \n\n\n\\WP_Post::get_instance( $id );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, GraphQL passes the Post down to the fields to be resolved. The fields use the Post as context to resolve the \nid\n, \ntitle\n, and \ncustomField\n. \n\n\nOnce all fields are resolved, GraphQL returns the response in JSON format.",

For example, clicking  RooyQuery  displays the fields that are available as part of the root. You can scroll through the list to see what's available. what the description is, what Type will be returned, and what arguments the field accepts.   When looking at the GraphQL Docs, it might be overwhelming trying to understand what everything is that you're seeing.

We have tutorials written up on how to do this!\n\n\nLearn more about using Custom Post Types \n Taxonomies with WPGraphQL\n\n\nHow to override a field's resolver?\n\n\nSometimes you need granular control over how a specific field resolves. Field resolvers can easily be filtered so that you can control what is returned.\n\n\nLearn more about overriding Field resolvers\n\n\nWhat are \"edges\" and \"nodes\"?\n\n\nGraphQL itself makes no mandates on the shape of a Schema. This is great, but can also be problematic as a poorly defined schema can be difficult to use, extend, and version.\n\n\nThe shape of the WPGraphQL Schema is inspired heavily by the \nRelay spec\n.\n\n\nThe Relay spec introduces the concept of \nConnections\n. \n\n\nLet's compare what a naiive schema and a schema with Relay connections looks like.\n\n\nNaive Schema\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    id\n    title\n    date\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection Schema\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nedges\n serve as a place for where \"edge\" data can be exposed. The most common example is pagination cursors. \n\n\nPagination\n\n\nIn the \nnaiive schema\n, we just get a list of posts back. There's no data exposed that references where each\npost belongs in the larger data set. For pagination to work well, we need to be able to pass data back in our next query\nto indicate what posts we want to query next. \n\n\nThe cursor for a connection can be queried like so:\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    pageInfo {\n      hasNextPage\n      hasPreviousPage\n      startCursor\n      endCursor\n    }\n    edges {\n      cursor\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we ask for \npageInfo\n on the connection itself, where we ask for the \nstartCursor\n and \nendCursor\n. Additionally we ask for a cursor\nfor each \"node\" in the connection. \n\n\nThe cursor can be used as a reference to where in the overall data-set we are, and can be used to tell WPGraphQL where to start\nthe next query.\n\n\nFor example, if we queried for 10 items, and wanted to paginate through asking for the next 10 items, we could do so by first asking for 10 posts:\n\n\n{\n   posts( first: 10 ) {\n       pageInfo {\n         hasNextPage\n         hasPreviousPage\n         startCursor\n         endCursor\n       }\n       edges {\n         cursor\n         node {\n           id\n           title\n           date\n         }\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we would store the \nendCursor\n as a variable \n$endCursor = query.posts.pageInfo.endCursor\n and use that to tell WPGraphQL where to start the next query, like so:\n\n\n{\n   posts( first: 10, after: $endCursor ) {\n       pageInfo {\n         hasNextPage\n         hasPreviousPage\n         startCursor\n         endCursor\n       }\n       edges {\n         cursor\n         node {\n           id\n           title\n           date\n         }\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL takes the \nafter\n argument on the connection, and uses that to determine where to start the query and get the 10 posts after that point in the data set.\n\n\n\n\nVariables with GraphQL\n\n\nThis is a basic example showing variables in GraphQL Query. As you work with GraphQL more, there are better ways to handle variables in your GraphQL requests. \nLearn more about using GraphQL variables\n\n\n\n\nOther Edge Data\n\n\nPagination is an important part of the \"connection\" shape of the Schema, but \"edges\" provide a great spot for other info\nthat's not a property of either \"node\" in a connection. \n\n\nOne hypothetical example of edge data, would be a \nfriendsSince\n field on a connection between 2 friends in a Schema. A field like that isn't\na property of either user, it's a property that exists only in the context of the connection. A naiive schema wouldn't have a good way\nto display this \"edge\" data, but the Relay connection spec provides the nested edges/node shape to make it easy to query for \"edge\" data when needed.\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought\n\n\nPossibly WordPress will one day have a formal way to store Term_Relationship_Meta or Object_Relationship_Meta, where data can be stored when info about specific connections is needed. This would be perfect for displaying as \"edge\" data in the GraphQL Schema.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a GraphQL Client?\n\n\nA GraphQL client is anything that makes requests to a GraphQL server. Anything that can make an HTTP POST request (CURL, Postman, basically any programming language) can be a GraphQL client.\n\n\nIt's most common to use GraphQL in the context of JavaScript single page apps or native iOS and Android apps, and in that case, our recommendation is to use \nApollo Client\n. \n\n\nApollo Client is a caching GraphQL client that eases managing GraphQL requests and caches and normalized the responses a GraphQL server provides. Apollo client is community driven and is used by industry leaders including The New York Times, Qz.com, Intuit, IBM, KLM and more.\n\n\nWhy is the HTTP status 403?\n\n\nUnlike REST, where each endpoint represents a single resource, GraphQL allows for multiple resources to be fetched at once. Some data might be public, and some might not be. Some might resolve fine, and some might have errors.\n\n\nBecause of this, WPGraphQL will resolve as much of the data as it can and return it, and will return errors associated with the data it couldn't resolve.\n\n\nThe 403 status is default to indicate that the request is not authenticated. It doesn't mean there is anything wrong. WPGraphQL will still resolve the data that\ndoesn't require any type of authentication (which in many cases is all the data that was requested). \n\n\nHowever, for requests for private data or Mutations where authentication is required, it becomes more important to be able to identify when the server properly identifies authentication and when it doesn't.\n\n\nBy returning a 403 status for non-authenticated requests and a 200 status for authenticated requests, clients (such as Apollo) can use the status to ask users to re-authenticate as needed, for example when an Auth token has expired or a Password was changed, or any other reason authentication might fail on subsequent requests.\n\n\nHow many houses are in Iowa?\n\n\nNot sure why this is frequently asked, or if it even is, but you won't find the answer here...\n\n\nWhat if I have a new question?\n\n\nIf you have a question that isn't answered in the FAQ or in any of Tutorials or Reference guide, feel free to create an issue in Github, but be as specific and detailed as possible to give us the best chance to help you. \n\n\nAdditionally, you can reach out to the greater WPGraphQL community on Slack: \njoin here",
